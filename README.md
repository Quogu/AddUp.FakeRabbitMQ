# AddUp.RabbitMQ.Fakes

## About

**AddUp.RabbitMQ.Fakes** is a fork of <https://github.com/Parametric/RabbitMQ.Fakes>.

**AddUp.RabbitMQ.Fakes** is a library that contains fake implementations of the **RabbitMQ.Client** interfaces. These are intended to be used for testing so that unit tests that depend on RabbitMQ can be executed fully in memory withouth needing an external RabbitMQ server.

**AddUp.RabbitMQ.Fakes** builds on top of the original project:

* Targets .NET Standard 2.0 (_WIP_)
* Supports Topic and Fanout exchange types (_WIP_)
