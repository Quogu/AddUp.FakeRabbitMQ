## Important Notice

On _2020/10/04_, and starting with version 1.2.3, **AddUp.RabbitMQ.Fakes** was renamed to **AddUp.FakeRabbitMQ**. This concerns:

* This repository name: <https://github.com/addupsolutions/AddUp.FakeRabbitMQ>,
* The Nuget package name: <https://www.nuget.org/packages/AddUp.FakeRabbitMQ/>,
* The Assembly name: `AddUp.FakeRabbitMQ.dll`.

However, the root namespace remains (for compatibility purpose) `AddUp.RabbitMQ.Fakes`.

I deemed this renaming necessary as the `Fakes` suffix collides with [Microsoft Fakes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/isolating-code-under-test-with-microsoft-fakes?view=vs-2019) product. Because the assembly name ends with `.Fakes`, several unit-test related tools consider it not to be a _real_ assembly but rather something generated by **Microsoft Fakes**.

## About

**AddUp.FakeRabbitMQ** is a fork of <https://github.com/Parametric/RabbitMQ.Fakes>. Thanks to the folks over there for their work without which our own version would have probably never seen the light.

**AddUp.FakeRabbitMQ** provides fake implementations of the **RabbitMQ.Client** interfaces (see <https://www.nuget.org/packages/RabbitMQ.Client> for the nuget package and <https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client> for its source code). They are intended to be used for testing so that unit tests that depend on RabbitMQ can be executed fully in memory withouth needing an external RabbitMQ server.

**AddUp.FakeRabbitMQ** builds on top of the original project:

* Targets **.NET Standard 2.0**
* Supports Default, Direct, Topic and Fanout exchange types.
  * _NB: Headers exchange type is not supported; however, it won't throw (it is implemented the same way as the Fanout type)_

## History

### [Version 1.3.1 - 2020/11/23](https://github.com/addupsolutions/AddUp.FakeRabbitMQ/releases/tag/v1.3.1)

* BUGFIX: #25. Now it is possible to close a `Channel` after its connection was closed without the `Channel.Close` method throwing (this is consistent with how **RabbitMQ.Client** behaves).

### [Version 1.3.0 - 2020/11/09](https://github.com/addupsolutions/AddUp.FakeRabbitMQ/releases/tag/v1.3.0)

Most of the work in this release was contributed by @inbarbarkai. Thanks to him!

* As suggested by @inbarbarkai: Basic support for `IModel.ConfirmSelect` and the `IModel.WaitForConfirms*` family.
* Support for `IModel.CreateBasicPublishBatch` was added thanks to PR #21 by @inbarbarkai.
* Consumers that implement both `IBasicConsumer` **and** `IAsyncBasicConsumer` are correctly handled by `IModel.BasicConsume` and `IModel.BasicCancel` thanks to PR #23 by @inbarbarkai.

### [Version 1.2.3 - 2020/10/04](https://github.com/addupsolutions/AddUp.FakeRabbitMQ/releases/tag/v1.2.3)

* Renamed from **AddUp.RabbitMQ.Fakes** to **AddUp.FakeRabbitMQ**.

### [Version 1.2.2 - 2020/06/02](https://github.com/addupsolutions/AddUp.RabbitMQ.Fakes/releases/tag/v1.2.2)

* BUGFIX: Closing a connection could throw if owned models were closed before.

### [Version 1.2.1 - 2020/05/30](https://github.com/addupsolutions/AddUp.RabbitMQ.Fakes/releases/tag/v1.2.1)

* Updated to **RabbitMQ.Client** to version [5.2.0](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#changes-between-512-and-520)

### [Version 1.2.0 - 2019/12/11](https://github.com/addupsolutions/AddUp.RabbitMQ.Fakes/releases/tag/v1.2.0)

* First released version of **AddUp.RabbitMQ.Fakes**. Based on [RabbitMQ.Client version 5.1.2](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RabbitMQ.Client/5.1.2)
* _NB: the version starts at 1.2.0 so as not to collide with previous internal versions._
